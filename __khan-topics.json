Dutch artists sought out new subjects of interest to their new clientele, scenes of everyday life (genre paintings), landscapes and still-lifes. There was also an enormous market for portraits.

Hardly what we would consider modern and appropriate for an industrial, commercial, urban culture! Courbet agreed, and so did his friend, the writer Charles Baudelaire who called for an art that would depict, as he called it, the beauty of modern life. Courbet painted the reality of life in the countryside—not the idealized peasants that were the usual fare at the exhibits in Paris. The revolution of 1848, in which both the working class and the middle class played a significant role, set the stage for Realism. Later, Manet and then Degas painted modern life in Paris, a city which was undergoing rapid modernization in the period after 1855 (the Second Empire).","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/avant-garde-france/realism"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Art History: Impressionism (The birth of the avant-garde in France)","blurb":"Brought to you by Smarthistory. Impressionism is both a style and the name of a group of artists who did something radical—in 1874 they banded together and held their own independent exhibition. These artists described, in fleeting sensations of light, the new leisure pastimes of the city and its suburbs. It’s hard to imagine, but at this time in France, the only place of consequence that artists could exhibit their work was the official government-sanctioned exhibitions (called salons), held just once a year, and controlled by a conservative jury. The Impressionists painted modern Paris and landscapes with a loose open brushstrokes, bright colors, and unconventional compositions—none of which was appreciated by the salon jury!","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/avant-garde-france/impressionism"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Art History: Post-Impressionism (The birth of the avant-garde in France)","blurb":"Brought to you by Smarthistory.

Ironically, if anything ties these artists together it is this focus on subjectivity. This tutorial explores the sketchy multiperspectival views of Cézanne, Seurat’s systematized critiques of upper middle-class Paris, Gauguin’s fascination with the primitive and exotic, and van Gogh’s unerring ability to convey deeply human experiences.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/avant-garde-france/post-impressionism"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Sculpture (The birth of the avant-garde in France)","blurb":"Brought to you by Smarthistory.

How does our body automatically seem to know when to inhale more, and when to inhale less? Also, if we do have autonomic control of breathing, how is it possible to also have conscious control of our breathing?

The filmmaking team refines the films through the parts of their process called pitching and feedback. Pitching is the process of telling your story in very rough form, using storyboards or other rough imagery.  After you pitch, you get feedback, which is basically hearing from the people you’re pitching to what they liked and didn’t like.  This helps the storyteller assess what is working about their story, and what is not.  Pixar goes through this over and over - storyboarding, pitching, getting feedback, re-boarding, and re-pitching - to hone in on the story they really want to tell.  Once the film is working in storyboard form, it moves on to Editorial, the department responsible for adding dialogue, music, and sound effects, and figuring out the timing for the entire film.  In this lesson you’ll learn how the storyboarding, pitching, feedback, and editorial processes work at Pixar, and you’ll start to apply these ideas to your own stories.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling/storyboard-your-film"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Introduction to lighting (The art of lighting)","blurb":"Overview of the lighting process at Pixar.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/art-of-lighting/introduction-to-virtual-lighting"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Hair simulation 101 (Hair Simulation)","blurb":"Explore how millions of hairs can be simulated using a mass spring system.

Since 1995, hundreds of “exoplanets,” or planets outside of our Solar System, have been discovered orbiting other stars. The Earth and our Solar System are not as unique as they were once thought to be. Planet formation is now considered to be very common in the Universe, and planets can form in the wake of the formation of any star. Star formation begins in giant gas clouds, and probably 99.9 percent of the material in these clouds goes into making the star. Only about 0.1 percent of the material in the original gas cloud is left for planet formation. This leftover material orbits the star and various forces cause the materials to begin crashing into one another. Over time, this process leads to the formation of very large objects—what we know as planets. Sometimes rocky like our Earth, sometimes gassy like Jupiter, these planets gather mass as other floating debris crashes onto their surfaces. In the early days of our Solar System, the Earth was constantly bombarded with floating debris. Over time, things settled down and the Earth cooled, making it the perfect place for life to form.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/solar-system-and-earth/earth-and-form-solar-system"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"4.1—What Was Young Earth Like?

The Earth that we know today, the relatively peaceful home of myriad forms of life, didn’t appear overnight. Rather, it took billions of years to slowly evolve into its current form. The process of accretion that led to the formation of the Earth was a violent one, and it produced an Earth that was only a little less violent and hostile. For a few hundred million years, the early Earth was characterized by high temperatures, toxic gases, high levels of radiation, and ongoing high-impact collisions. Over time, these conditions improved and the Earth took on its distinctive structure with differentiated layers of core, mantle, crust, and atmosphere. This distinctive structure has important consequences: First, it helps explain why the surface of the Earth changes over time; and second, it helps explain why the Earth evolved into a suitable setting for living things.

In this lesson, you will learn that the surface of the Earth changes as well. The high temperatures that caused the differentiation of the Earth’s layers continue even today. In a process known as plate tectonics, the heat and movement of the mantle floating under the Earth’s crust drive the movement of the Earth’s crust over its surface.

Planets also differ from stars because they don’t generate huge amounts of energy at their centers. As a result, their surface temperatures are much cooler. This combination of diverse chemical ingredients and less violent conditions enabled planets to become the setting for life. When life emerged on Earth, it had characteristics that made it very different from nonliving things. Many people will tell you they “know” the difference between living and nonliving things.

The water, plants, and animals of the biosphere provide humans with many of the resources we need for survival. But as amazing the biosphere is in creating a “comfort zone” for humans, it can also be quite fragile, and from time to time has been subject to significant threats from various astronomical, geological, and biological forces.

This makes it much easier for each generation to pick up where the previous one left off, and it’s why we are the only species able to dominate the biosphere. But why have humans evolved into such a powerful species? What makes us special?

For a long time, humans met their energy needs almost exclusively by eating the food they foraged in their local environment. In other words, humans were completely dependent on the plants and animals that nature provided. The invention of farming about 12,000 years ago gave humans access to vast new food and energy resources, which helped to dramatically transform the way humans lived. Among other things, farming made possible dramatic population growth, and it allowed humans to settle in larger, denser communities than a foraging lifestyle could support. These larger and denser communities eventually led to the development of cities and civilizations, which accelerated collective learning and innovation.

Because domestication gave people more control over the plants and animals in an area, human groups could grow bigger and denser. As these populations grew and turned into cities, states, and empires, greater opportunities for collective learning evolved but so did the types of challenges human communities had to face. Population growth, specialization of labor, and the emergence of rulers and social hierarchies all paved the way for increased collective learning, but they also created some complex problems and relationships that we are still struggling to resolve today.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/agriculture-civilization/first-cities-states"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"7.2 Where and why did the first cities appear?

But not every civilization has left behind such noticeable clues. In fact, many artifacts from agrarian civilizations fade away with time. But the clues that remain become important windows to the past. Researchers in a variety of disciplines such as history and archaeology use both written record and historical artifacts to pose, analyze, and answer questions about the past. As you will see, written record is of particular importance. Unlike other species, writing gives us the ability to preserve and pass on large amounts of information from one generation to the next. With this ability comes incredible power.\n","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/agriculture-civilization/first-cities-appear"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Glossary (7.

Expansion & Interconnection)","blurb":"For most of the agrarian era, the world was divided into four separate and distinct world zones. Over time, these zones slowly became more connected as networks of communication and exchange expanded. While innovations did occur throughout this era, such as irrigation, iron plows, and fast-ripening rice, none of these innovations were able to sustain long-term population growth, which limited expansion. Each innovation led to immediate growth, but once populations had grown beyond a certain point, they fell. These cycles of rise and fall in population, called Malthusian cycles, characterized the agrarian era. Humans would not break out of these cycles until the world zones became more connected and rates of innovation were capable of sustaining growth over much longer periods of time.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/expansion-interconnection/expansion"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"8.1—Exploration & Interconnection (8.

The voyages of Christopher Columbus extended this exchange from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, which saw a massive movement of ideas, people, diseases, plants, and animals between the two hemispheres. The results of these exchanges were dramatic. Potatoes and corn, first cultivated in the Americas, quickly became crucial in the diets of people across Eurasia. Horses and cattle, unknown in the New World in 1492, quickly took on crucial roles in many societies in the Americas. The linking of the different world zones in this period and the exchanges that this linking made possible, transformed the lifeways of the people and civilizations involved – and laid the foundation for modern exchange routes and the global balance of power.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/expansion-interconnection/exploration-interconnection"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"8.2—Commerce & Collective Learning (8.

Systems of exchange and trade between large agrarian civilizations facilitated the transfer of goods from one civilization to the next, but they also helped share the world’s religions, ideas, innovations, diseases, and people. While each world zone had its own trade routes, none were as vast and intense as the Silk Road. This large system of exchange and trade, initially designed for commerce, dispersed goods and ideas throughout Afro-Eurasia, and paved the way for a substantial increase in both commerce and collective learning.","category":"khan","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/expansion-interconnection/commerce-collective-learning"},{"userLabel":"Khan Academy","name":"Glossary (8.

The world, in effect, was divided into four unconnected regions, none of which was really interested in the others. With the improved transportation and communication technologies developed 500 years ago, humans acquired the means for connecting these formerly independent zones. After 1492, for example, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were put in regular contact, and the Columbian Exchange saw the transfer of people, ideas, animals, plants, and diseases between these two once separate world zones. Exchanges like these fueled social, political, economic, and intellectual innovation. Within a few hundred years, this more fully connected world saw dramatic acceleration in innovation and population growth, which ushered in the Modern Revolution.

Whether you look at temperature, types of vegetation, soils, or sea level, the basic characteristics of the biosphere have remained about the same, having shown only moderate variation at any point within most of that time frame. That type of consistency is what prompted geologists to label the last 10,000 years of geological history as the Holocene Epoch; an epoch that was ushered in at the end of the last ice age. But there are now a number of scientists who view the data from the last 250 years and conclude that the biosphere is showing fundamentally different characteristics from the previous 10,000 years. The rise of carbon dioxide levels, glacial melting, and the shrinking of tropical rainforests are just some of the factors that they cite as evidence that the biosphere has entered a new epoch. Because so much of the change they have identified seems to derive from human activity, these scientists propose that this new epoch be called the Anthropocene to reflect the tremendous impact that humans now exert in the biosphere.

Acceleration)","blurb":"The Modern Revolution created the world we live in today. This world is very different from the world of 500 or 1,000 years ago, let alone 10,000 or 100,000 years ago. The connection of the four world zones allowed for the creation of a global network of exchange. Though this network was not built overnight, it emerged fairly quickly, and it increased the potential connections and diversity of connections for many members of the network. The result was an acceleration of both collective learning and innovation. Commerce was an important driver of change in this global network. Because commerce began to take on greater significance for many societies, a number of important thinkers began to ask questions about the nature of the exchange of goods, the nature of productivity and efficiency, and the interests of the individual and the state in business. All of this new inquiry gave birth to the discipline of economics. These economic thinkers, like the thinkers in any discipline, shared a set of concerns and questions but often came up with very different answers to those questions. The articulation of the ideas of capitalism and communism were the most influential economic ideas generated in the course of the Modern Revolution.

It would be impossible for any history course to cover everything related to its subject matter, and this challenge is particularly great in Big History because of the scales of time and size involved. Big History deals with this challenge by focusing on the eight turning points, or thresholds, over the course of the 13.8 billion-year story. At each of these thresholds, the Universe became more complex, and things appeared with significant new emergent properties.

The dinosaurs, for example, became extinct as a result of an astronomical event—the effects of an asteroid impact on Earth. Every species impacts the biosphere, though the extent of that impact can vary dramatically. The impact of humans has changed over time. The impact of foragers was not dramatic, but these early humans did have the ability to destroy flora and fauna and cause fires in different parts of the Earth. Agriculture, and later the modern revolution, significantly increased the impact of humans on the biosphere. The acceleration of the last 100 years has seen an acceleration of these human impacts on the biosphere. What are the most significant of these impacts and what should humans be doing about them?

Physicists, for example, can look at the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Universe today and draw conclusions about the early history of the Universe. Geologists can look at the distribution of plants and animals and rock formations on the Earth today and draw conclusions about the how the configuration of the Earth’s continents has changed over time. Each discipline has its own questions and evidence and is interested in investigating change over time.
